1. User can take more items than that are in inventory
    -- we could remove the functionality of adding same items multiple times from the productScreen.jsx component.
    -- we can check what is the amount of the item that is in the cart through redux.
    -- we could set selectable options according to the item number for the user's localStorge or rudux store.

2. Move Card.jsx and LinkButton.jsx from Utils to components

3. logout should reload the page automatically so that current state get updated.

4. Need to update 'cartUtils.js' because same calculation logic is used in both backend and fronent. Make it reusable.

5.


problems:
1. req.cookies doesn't get cookie. cookie sending doesn't work. thus, req.user doesn't get user.      SOLVED
In postman it works fine, but not in browser. The problem is for rtk query. fetchBaseQuery. Normal fetch would work fine.

Solution: 

##set cors, cookieParser:

app.use(
  cors({
    credentials: true,
    origin: "http://localhost:5173",
  })
);

app.use(cookieParser({ sameSite: "Strict", secure: true }));

## Modify 'apiSlice' -- fetchBaseQuery:
we have to add  
    credentials: "include",  in fetchBaseQuery:

baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({
  baseUrl: BASE_URL,
  credentials: "include",
}),
